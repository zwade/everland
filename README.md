# Everland

Welcome to Everland, a place of terror and despair. Can you face all the foes, and return with the coveted prize?

SML-Based reversing(ish) challenge with full source. Exploitable by using two bugs, one is a poor heuristic that can be used to force enemies to kill themselves, and one is a bug with references that allows you to instakill the final boss.

Undecided yet as to whether it should be a public file (i.e. given the binary and the source with the source's flag unlisted), or to operate it on a server.
